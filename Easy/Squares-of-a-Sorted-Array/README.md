**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]  
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]  
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].  
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].  


**Constraints:**

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
