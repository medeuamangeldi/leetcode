**Problem Statement:**

Given the root of a binary search tree and a target value, return the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286  
Output: 4

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].  
0 <= Node.val <= 10^9  
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
